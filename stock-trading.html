                <h4 class="title font2 font3 fw-600">Trade Stocks CFDs</h4>
                <p class="subtitle">Share CFDs (Contracts for Difference) have become increasingly popular over recent
                    years.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">When you enter into a CFD trade you don’t buy the stock itself but instead agree a
                    contract with the broker to settle the difference in value between the entry and exit price of the
                    Stock. That means when you trade Stocks CFDs with UnixCapitals you get a flexibility that stock
                    market
                    rules often make impossible.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">With CFDs you can sell shares as easily as buying them, allowing you to take
                    advantage of price moves even in a falling market. More importantly, because you aren’t actually
                    purchasing the underlying asset you can get leverage of up to 20:1, allowing you to take a large
                    position with a small investment. Leverage of course can significantly increase your losses as well
                    as your gains.</p>


                <h4 class="title font2 font3 fw-600">How to Buy Stocks</h4>
                <p class="subtitle">When looking to buy stocks, there are a few different options that the average
                    trader has. There is the route of buying stocks directly from a stock broker, but one could incur
                    major fees and commissions for having the broker facilitate your trade. This is the old way of stock
                    trading and harkens back to the days when someone would place a phone call to execute a trade.</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Also, some of the costs associated with traditional stock trading can be extreme,
                    especially considering how many stock options are Forex Templateilable today as well as the high
                    cost of some of the popular global shares.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Beyond the traditional option, there is online stock trading, giving one access to
                    online brokers. Some of these brokers offer reduced costs, but in many cases, the investor is
                    required to pay a range of fees and commissions for their trading activities.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">While the minimum trading requirement is reduced at some online brokers, the fee
                    schedule is excessive, putting a strain on the investor’s profit/ loss ratio. Beyond this, some
                    online brokers only offer access to some markets, such as forex and stocks. This could leave you
                    somewhat limited in your trading choices especially if you prefer trading cryptocurrencies or
                    commodities.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">To top it off, many online brokers have started offering ‘pink sheets’ stocks, which
                    are over the counter stocks that are unreliable and volatile. In many cases, information regarding
                    the companies may be difficult to find due to the poor reporting of financial statements. This is
                    also the market used for the sale and purchase of penny stocks, also often referred to as ‘cheap
                    stocks’.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">These sell for very small sums of money and while the low price can result in big
                    profits, penny stocks are considered very high risk. To put it into perspective, some penny stock
                    companies have no assets, and provide no services or goods. There has been more than one penny stock
                    that has led to financial ruin for investors.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">If you are tech savvy, you might have come across a wide range of investment apps.
                    While these apps are convenient and bring stock trading right into the palms of your hands, some of
                    these apps only offer limited investment opportunities and are limited in their overall evaluation
                    of your financial situation. Before one invests, it is always wise to evaluate a number of factors
                    including your tax situation, any debts and other investments. This is where a online broker takes
                    centre stage.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">On the whole, stocks trading has a few pros and cons. On the one hand, there is the
                    ability to earn dividends and to store wealth in a widely recognised financial instrument. On the
                    other hand, you have other issues, such as panic selling during bear markets, the major difficulty
                    associated with short-selling, and of course, the rather high volatility that stocks can have.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Compare all of this with stock CFD trading. This form of trading allows you to trade
                    with leverage, preserving your trading capital for other opportunities. Beyond this, you can simply
                    short the stock without borrowing the shares to sell as you have to with the traditional route. CFDs
                    are one of the easiest ways to speculate on an underlying asset, and as a result, they have exploded
                    in popularity.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">In addition, the only costs associated with stock CFD trading will be the bid/ask
                    spread. This brings down the costs of stock trading to very little and removes the broker commission
                    out of the picture completely.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">The ability to trade these stocks in this environment is one of the things that many
                    retail traders have come to love. By using this as a financial way to express your views of a
                    company, you are able to do so with low margin, and in both directions, without the fees and
                    complications that may arise.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">While you don’t take actual ownership of the underlying shares of the company, you
                    do get to enjoy the most important thing that short-term and swing traders look for: the ability to
                    pinpoint potentially lucrative trading opportunities in the market and to profit from them.</p>
