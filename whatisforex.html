                     currencies with the purpose of making profit off the changes in their value. As the biggest
                     market in the world by far, larger than the stock market or any other, there is high liquidity
                     in the forex market. Therefore, the forex market attracts many traders, beginners and

                     the highest liquidity in the world. Basically, this means that one can buy almost any currency he
                     wishes in high volumes while the market is open. The forex market is open 24 hours, 5 days a week –
                     Monday to Friday. Trading begins with the opening of the market in Australia, Asia, Europe to
                     follow and then the USA until the markets close.</p>

                  There are hundreds of currencies in the world, and each has a three letter symbol. American Dollars
                  are USD, Euros are EUR, Swiss Francs are CHF, British Pounds are GBP and onwards to all the

                  Currencies are divided into two main sorts – Major currencies and minor ones. The major currencies are
                  derived from the most powerful economies around the globe – the US, Japan, the UK, the Euro Zone,
                  Canada, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand. Together with the other currencies they create forex
                  pairs.

                  When going to a store to buy groceries, we need to exchange one valuable asset for another – money for
                  milk, for example. The same goes for trading forex – we buy or sell one currency for the other. The
                  currencies in the pairs are referred to as one against another.
               </p>
               <p class="text-white w-100 mw-100">
                  There are three types of forex pairs; Major pairs, Minor pairs and Exotic pairs. The major pairs
                  always involve the USD, and are the most traded ones. The seven major pairs are <b>EURUSD, USDJPY,
                     GBPUSD, USDCAD, USDCHF, AUDUSD</b> and <b>NZDUSD</b>. In the minor pairs the major currencies are
                  traded between each other, excluding the USD. These can be EURGBP, GBPJPY and others. The exotic pairs
                  have one major currency and one minor, such as EURTRY, USDNOK and many more.

                  <p class="text-white w-100 mw-100">The most popular pair traded is the Euro vs. the American Dollar,
                     or EURUSD. The currency on the
                     left is called the base currency, and is the one we wish to buy or sell; the one on the right is
                     the secondary currency, and is the one we use to make the transaction. Each pair has two prices –
                     the price for selling the base currency (ask) and a price for buying it (bid). The difference
                     between them is called a spread, and represents the amount brokers charge to open the position. The
                     more a currency is traded, i.e. high liquidity, its spreads will be narrower. The rarer the pair
                     is, the wider the spreads will be, since lower liquidity usually entails increased volatility. The
                     increased risk – consequently – entails a wider spread.</p>
                  <p class="text-white w-100 mw-100">Usually a quote will be presented with four numbers after the dot,
                     for instance 1.2356. In the case
                     of EURUSD it means for every Euro the trader wishes to buy he will have to invest 1.2356 US
                     dollars. Any change in the currency value will usually be seen on the fourth figure after the dot,
                     mainly known as a PIP The spreads, gains and losses will usually be presented in pips.</p>
                  <p class="text-white w-100 mw-100">Some other terms of the online forex trading world are Going long
                     and Going short, which stand
                     respectively for ‘buying’ and ‘selling’. A trader who speculates the market will rise is called a
                     ‘Bullish Trader’, while on the other side stands the ‘Bearish Trader’, who is more on the defensive
                     side. In accordance, the terms ‘Bull Market’ and ‘Bear Market’ are used to describe the way the
                     market goes.</p>

                     trades are done directly by the client on a software, called a trading platform. Many of the
                     platforms are Forex Templateilable for computer, internet and mobile. Every trader has his own
                     trading strategy, and he should find the platform that will enable him to perform it in the best
                     way possible, i.e. that he will feel most comfortable in.</p>

                  Leverage is given by the broker to enable traders to hold trading positions that are larger than what
                  one’s own capital would otherwise allow.
               </p>
               <p>
                  It is important to remember that the profits and losses are determined by the position size, and as
                  leverage trading can magnify profits also losses can be enhanced, thus proper risk management
                  techniques have to be used.

            <div class="col-md-12">
               <p>
                  The forex market has high liquidity, due to an elevated supply and demand rate. Traders apply
                  transactions based on financial events, as well as general events. Naturally, when a currency will be
                  on a high demand, its value will raise comparing to the other currencies, and vice versa.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Financial events are frequent statements by countries, central banks or other financial institutions,
                  on topics such as unemployment rate, manufacture numbers and many more. A decrease in a country’s
                  unemployment rate can indicate that the economy is strong, and this can lead to an increase of the
                  local currency.
               </p>
               <p>
                  If it’s a major one it will affect other currencies as well. Before the event takes place traders
                  speculate on its content, and based on these speculations open positions. All the events can be seen
                  and followed on theeconomic calendar.
               </p>
            </div>

               <p>
                  Going back to the popular trading pair – the EURUSD. Once logged into the platform the trader will
                  check the ask and bid prices; for the purpose of the example they will be 1.2356 (ask), and 1.2359
                  (bid). The difference, as noted, is of 3 pips and this will go to the broker.
               </p>
               <p>
                  If the trader believes the Euro will go up he will enter a ‘buy’ command. Then he will be required to
                  select an amount – say 10,000 units. The price for that is $12,356, and using leverage it comes to
                  $30.89. If the market responded the way the trader predicted and the Euro rose from 1.2356 to 1.2360 –
                  4 pips, the trader would have made a profit from this trade.
