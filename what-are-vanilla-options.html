                        <p class="">Vanilla options are contracts giving traders the right to buy or sell a specified
                            amount of an instrument, at a certain price on a pre-defined time. When trading vanilla
                            options, the trader has the power to control not only the instrument and the amount he
                            trades, but also when and at what price. Options can be traded for a day, a week, a few
                            months or even a year.
                        </p>
                        <p>Trading options is a mystery for many people. Many would choose trading spot over options,
                            but once getting into the options – traders get hooked. The variety of choices, with the
                            ability to control all aspects of a trade, properly balancing risks and rewards, welcomes
                            traders to an exciting world where all options are open.</p>

                        <b>premium</b>. When
                        the trader acts as the buyer he pays the premium, and when selling an option he receives it. The
                        premium is decided by a few factors; the current rate or price of the instrument is the first
                        one. In addition, since options are contracts to trade in the future, there is a time element.
                        The date on which the option can be exercised is called the <b>expiration date</b>, and the
                        price at which the option buyer can choose to execute is the <b>strike price</b>. Longer dated
                        options have higher premiums than shorter dated options, much like buying insurance.

                                <span>The first step in trading options is to determine the market view for the chosen
                                    instrument. If a trader believes a certain instrument will rise, he has three ways
                                    to express that view. The first would be to buy the instrument’s outright, i.e. with
                                    regular spot trading.</span>
                            </li>

                                <span>The second is to buy a call option. With this strategy, the most he can lose is
                                    the premium, paid up front. This position can be sold at any time. This is the
                                    safest way to express a bullish view.</span>

                                <span>The third course of action is to sell a put option. If the instrument is higher
                                    than the strike price at expiration, the option will expire worthless – and the
                                    trader keeps the entire premium he collected upfront.</span>

                        Another key factor in determining the premium is the volatility of the underlying instrument.
                        High volatility increases the price of the option, as higher volatility means there is a greater
                        likelihood of a larger market move that can bring about profits – potentially even before the
                        option has reached its strike price. A trader can choose to close his option position on any
                        trading day, profiting from a higher premium, whether it has risen due to increased volatility
                        or the market moving his way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Scenario:</b> The current price for EURUSD pair is 1.1000. The trader speculates it will rise
                        within the week
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Spot trade:</b> In the first case scenario he will open a spot position for 10,000 units, on
                        any platform at the given spreads. If the EURUSD price moves higher, he instantly makes a
                        profit.</p>

                    <p><b>Buy Call Option:</b> In the second strategy, he buys a call option with one week to expiration
                        at a strike price, for example, of 1.1020. Once buying he pays the premium as shown in the
                        trading platform, for example, 0.0050 or 50 pips. If, at the expiration date, EURUSD exceeds the
                        strike price, he will earn the difference between the strike price and the prevailing EURUSD
                        rate. His breakeven level will be the strike price plus the premium he paid up front. He can
                        also profit at any time prior to expiration due to an increase in implied volatility or a move
                        higher in the EURUSD rate. The higher it goes, the more he can make.</p>

                    <p><b>Sell Put Option:</b> In the third case, he will sell a put option. Meaning he will act as the
                        seller, and receive the premium directly to his account. The risk he takes by selling an option
                        is that he is wrong about the market – and so he must be careful in choosing the strike price.
                        He should be comfortable in his view that EURUSD will not be below this level at expiration.</p>

                    <p>Another way to say it is that he must be comfortable buying EURUSD at the strike price, because
                        if spot finishes lower, the seller has the right to “put” EURUSD to him at the strike price. In
                        return for taking this risk, the option seller receives the upfront premium. If spot finishes
                        higher than the strike price, he keeps the premium and is free to sell another put, adding to
                        his income earned from the first trade.</p>

                    <p>In both options trading examples, the premium is set by the market, as shown in the Forex
                        TemplateOptions trading platform at the time of trade. The gains and losses, based on the strike
                        price, will be determined by the rate of the underlying instrument at expiration.</p>

                        At the end of the day, it is considered a safe investment in fact, for an option buyer, they are
                        far less risky than trading the underlying instruments. For a seller, the downside risks, too,
                        are less than that of being wrong on a spot trade, as the option seller gets to set the strike
                        price according to his risk appetite, and he earns a premium for having taken the risk. Options
                        do require an initial investment of time, to get to know the product.

                        In addition, options can be used to hedge spot positions, and as a result, risks are limited to
                        the premium amount. For instance, if you have a long position on an asset, such as a stock, you
                        can buy put options to hedge that underlying position. Put options rise in value when the
                        underlying asset’s price declines. So, if your long spot market position is generating a loss,
                        your put option position will generate profits, effectively protecting you against market
                        swings.

                        Perhaps the most unique advantage of options is that one can express almost any market view, by
                        combining long and short call and put options, and long or short spot positions. The trader is
                        bearish on USDJPY, but not sure? He can buy a put option for his target expiration date, sit
                        back and relax. Whether USDJPY goes up or down tomorrow, he is safe in his position all the way
                        to the expiration date. If he turns to be right, spot is lower than the strike price by at least
                        the premium value, he will earn profits.

                        Like any instrument, trading options has its risks and potential losses. However, there is a
                        major difference between trading spot and trading options. In spot trading the trader can only
                        speculate on the market direction – will it go up or down. With options, on the other hand, he
                        can execute a trading strategy based on many other factors – current price vs strike price,
                        time, market trends, risk appetite, and more, i.e. he has much more control over his portfolio,
                        and therefore more room for manoeuvre.

                        A major risk in trading financial derivatives is volatility. Volatility may occur as a result of
                        various factors, such as major news and events, that have a direct impact on the underlying
                        asset’s price.

                        Strangles and Straddles are the most efficient options trading strategies applied for volatility
                        trades. Strangles are applied when there is a directional bias, while Straddles are applied when
                        the expected price direction is unclear. In both strategies, though, options traders ensure that
                        their speculative bets are hedged. The Strangle and Straddle strategies can be applied in the
                        following ways:

                        Traders will apply short strangle and short straddle strategies when they expect the implied
                        volatility of the underlying asset to be low. In a short strangle, a trader buys both call and
                        put options with similar expiry times, but different strike prices. In a short straddle, a
                        trader will sell both call and put options of the same underlying asset with similar expiry
                        times and identical strike prices. In both scenarios, profits will be generated if the
                        underlying asset’s price ranges or does not make significant movement in either direction.
