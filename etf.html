                        <p class="">ETFs, or Exchange Traded Funds, are a type of investment fund that tracks underlying
                            assets like indices, bonds, commodities and divides ownership of those assets into shares.
                            ETFs are traded on an exchange, and their value shifts during the day, due to buying and
                            selling actions done by the traders. As ETFs trade just the same way stocks do, they do not
                            have their own net asset value (NAV), and they are calculated once at the close of every
                            market day</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p class="subtitle">An ETF is a collection of assets put together, to permit traders to trade in a
                        few markets simultaneously. The baskets are usually combined together with a common
                        characteristic such as energy instruments, agriculture instruments and others. If you wish to
                        trade a stock, commodity and bonds all together you can simply trade in the ETF market.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Some ETFs track the performance of a specific nation’s equity market. Examples
                        are the <b>MSCI Brazil Index Fund, MSCI South Korea Index Fund</b> and others. ETFs also make it
                        possible to invest in certain industry sectors. Examples offered by UnixCapitalsare the
                        <b>Dow-Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund</b> and the <b>Energy Select Sector SPDR</b>. It is
                        important to know that all ETFs are traded as CFDs.
                    </p>

                    <p class="subtitle">ETFs are traded as a basket of assets – stocks, commodities and more, put
                        together per sector. If you speculate that the energy market, for instance, will go up, you can
                        invest in a few trades simultaneously. A prominent advantage of ETFs is that often they balance
                        each other out; if one instrument’s value goes down, another instrument’s value can go up and
                        even it out. If the price of crude oil goes down, as part of the energy basket, a stock of the
                        same basket might even it out.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Commodity ETFs have grown in popularity over the last several years with retail
                        investors and even institutions. This is because of the simplicity and liquidity that can be
                        found in these markets. Remember, not all institutions will have the expertise to get involved
                        in the futures markets, so if they choose to take advantage of a trend in a particular market,
                        it is possible to do so with ETFs.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Let’s look at an example; if rising prices of energy are evident, what better
                        way to enter the markets than to buy oil and natural gas, as well as have the infrastructure to
                        do so? Also, what is easier? Buying each asset individually, or buying a single ETF? This can
                        easily be done via the XLE, which is the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF we offer here at The
                        Unity Fx. It is clearly evident that ETFs have changed the way traders now trade the markets.

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row ">

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p class="subtitle">At this point, the comparison of ETFs vs mutual funds should be explored. Both
                        are similar in that they both represent professionally managed baskets of individual stocks or
                        bonds. An ETF, however, is traded directly on an exchange and can be jumped in and out of
                        quickly. This is facilitated by many of the world’s financial markets that people know and
                        trust.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">The mutual fund is different because you buy into them through a broker and not
                        an exchange. Beyond that, the mutual fund typically has a higher minimum initial purchase
                        associated with it, and the holdings are opaquer, as they are normally actively managed. Here,
                        you are trusting the money manager to have the experience and knowledge to know what to do, and
                        you don’t have your own say in the investments.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">When looking at ETFs vs Index Funds, by far the most important differences are
                        the costs and the taxation differences between the two. At the end of the day, the ETF is
                        typically what traders choose, but if you are looking to invest in one position for the
                        long-term, the index fund can be a viable option. These index funds have been around for years,
                        and they do exactly what you think they would do – offer ownership of stocks that make up an
                        entire index, such as the S&amp;P 500.</p>

                    <h4 class=" font2 font3 fw-00">How to Trade ETFs with UnixCapitals</h4>
                    <p class="subtitle">Since ETFs play on the range of markets, you’ll need a broker that offers
                        trading in all those markets with good conditions. ETFs require knowing the markets well enough
                        to determine when to enter it and when to exit, and to know how each instrument will affect the
                        other. UnixCapitalsis aware of the ETFs’ special nature and helps you stay on top of the market,
                        to use the price changes to your favour.</p>
